      <h2>FAMOUS HORSES IN HISTORY </h2>

    <h3>BUCEPHALUS</h3>
      <p>
        He was tamed by young Alexander when no one else could break him.

        He was known for his courage and stamina, riding into many battles undaunted. It is believed that Bucephalus died from injuries sustained in battle.
      </p>
    <h3>SEABISCUIT</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most famous racehorses of the 20th Century, Seabiscuit’s story was one of unlikely success. Seabiscuit overcame a pitiful start in life to take on one of the most powerful racehorses of the time (War Admiral) and beat him.
      </p>
    <h3>BLACK BEAUTY</h3>
      <p>
        Black Beauty: The Autobiography of a Horse, the only novel by Anna Sewell and the first major animal story in children’s literature. The author wrote it “to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses”; it was published in 1877, shortly before Sewell’s death.
